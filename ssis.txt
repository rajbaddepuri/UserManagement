1. Create a simple package, one OLEDB source and Flat file destination.
2. Go to the Flat FIle connection properties
3. Go to the expression property for the same
4. Select the property as connection string and when you open the expression type the below code as it is:
for example: let's say my package name is: "ImportDatatoFlatFile"
"E:\\unical\\DynamicFlatFiles"+@[System::PackageName]+""+REPLACE((DT_STR,30,1252)GETDATE(),":","")
"E:\\unical\\DynamicFlatFiles"+PackageName]+""+REPLACE((DT_STR,30,1252)GETDATE(),":","")

\\
"E:\\unical\\DynamicFlatFiles"+""+REPLACE((DT_STR,30,1252)GETDATE(),":","")

@[User::OutputFolder]+REPLACE((DT_STR,30,1252)GETDATE(),":","_")+".txt"
"E:\\A-Learnings\\Miscellaneous\\TextFiles\\"+@[System::PackageName]+""+REPLACE((DT_STR,30,1252)GETDATE(),":","")

For the first time, we need to browse the connection to a flat file, to retriev the input columns and
their properties, but after the connection manager property change, it's not required.

NOTE:
We have to place an extra backward slash in the path as first '\' defines the next '\' slash character as a string.
we need to convert the DateTime to string format other wise it would not be recongnized as a part of the file name.
We need to replace the ":" sign in the time part because colon sign can not be a part of the file.
